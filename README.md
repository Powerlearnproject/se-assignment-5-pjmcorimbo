o	Add the remote repository URL using the command:
csharp
Copy code
git remote add origin <repository_url>
o	Replace <repository_url> with the URL copied from GitHub.
3.	Push Commits:
o	After staging and committing your changes, push them to GitHub:
css
Copy code
git push -u origin main
o	Replace main with your branch name if it's different (master for older repositories).
